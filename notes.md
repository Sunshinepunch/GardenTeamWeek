*TURN IN LINK Y'ALL*

<!-- links for drag n drop:

https://htmldom.dev/drag-and-drop-table-row/ -->


<!-- Plan - Create successful drag and drop interface for plants in plot -->


Anna & Connor - Clean up MVC, integrate API & MVC
Becket - Finalize dragndrop seeds into plots
Paige - Update MVC on current aim
Brandon - Host site for portfolio? (AWS? Not Azure)

Wednesday
Step 1 - Anna * Paige clean up MVC
Step 2 - Connor * Becket - finalize dragndrop seeds into plots
Lunch
Step 3 - Collaboratively integrate API, stragglers clean up leftover MVC bugs from morning

GOAL - Have successful API communications w/ MVC app


Thursday
Step 1 - TBD
Step 2 - Cry/Improve layout/styling. Throw more sinks.
Step 3 - Present


Things to Eliminate:
 - Squarefoots as selectable area - its not happening (delete)
 - Potentially simplify amount of data requested
OVERALL MVP - API that sends plant info - MVC that hosts custom plots (or just a single plot) with drag-n-drop 'seeds' that contain API info - Learning zone?! Enter your zipcode and get hardiness zone (API Call) on plot create view. Click link to go to Uncle Ted's Learning Shed
